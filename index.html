  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.

  <h2>What is Badminton?</h2>

<p>Badminton is a racquet sport played on a rectangular court divided by a net. Players use racquets to hit a shuttlecock (also called a birdie) over the net. The goal is to land the shuttlecock on the opponent's side of the court and prevent them from returning it.</p>

<h3 class="color">Types of Games:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Singles:</strong> One player on each side of the court.</li>
    <li><strong>Doubles:</strong> Two players on each side of the court.</li>
    <li><strong>Mixed Doubles:</strong> One male and one female player on each side of the court.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="color">Equipment:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Racquet:</strong> Lightweight frame strung with nylon or synthetic gut.</li>
    <li><strong>Shuttlecock:</strong> A small cone-shaped object with feathers or a synthetic skirt.</li>
    <li><strong>Net:</strong> Divides the court in half.</li>
    <li><strong>Court:</strong> Rectangular with specific dimensions for singles and doubles.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="color">Basic Rules:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> A match is usually played to the best of three games. Each game is played to 21 points (or 30 in some competitions).</li>
    <li><strong>Serving:</strong> The serve must be underhand and below the waist. The serve alternates between sides after each point.</li>
    <li><strong>Faults:</strong> A fault occurs when the shuttlecock hits the net or lands outside the court boundaries, or when a player touches the net with their body or racquet.</li>
    <li><strong>Winning a Point:</strong> A point is awarded to the side that wins a rally.</li>
    <li><strong>Winning a Game:</strong> The first side to reach 21 points (or 30) wins the game.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="color">Why Badminton is Popular:</h2>
